<section class="summary">
  I received my MSW from New York University and have obtained multiple experiences pursuing therapy in mental health clinics, child welfare settings, jails and homeless shelters. I have a passion for justice and for assisting those with mental illness. I have extensive training in behavioral health modalities (CBT, TFCBT, Prolonged Exposure, MI and DBT) with a base knowledge of psychotherapy. I am an action oriented and strengths based practitioner working towards creating sustainable change.
