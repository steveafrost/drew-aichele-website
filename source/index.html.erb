  <div class="col-sm-8 introduction">
    <p>My name is Drew and I want to thank you for visiting my page. Before exploring, here is a little introduction about myself.</p>

    <p>I have a few passions in life, as you can see by the tabs above, and I have a drive to pursue them all. I have been influenced by books such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mountains-Beyond-Quest-Farmer-Would/dp/0812973011">Mountains Beyond Mountains</a> by Tracy Kidder, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Resent-Poverty/dp/1503081036">Think and Grow Rich</a> by Napoleon Hill and Talks such as <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling">‘Why some of us don’t have one true calling’</a> by Emilie Wapnick. From moving often throughout my life, I have developed the skills of adaptability and WOO. I find that life is most joyful when lived with new challenges and experiences.</p>

    <p>Again, thank you for visiting and I would be happy to hear from you.</p>
