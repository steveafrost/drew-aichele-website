<blockquote>
  I'm super impressed. It looks much better than the commercial ones... and they cost a small fortune and have to be ordered months in advance! You should go into business.

<blockquote>
  So stunning. It looks so pretty and rustic, I would (almost) want to preserve it instead of eating it!
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  It looks incredible! Would you bake a cake for me? I don't have a wedding coming up. Or a birthday. I just want cake.
