<p>I have always had a passion for baking and cooking. Since a child, I have had the goal for pursuing this passion. I am always looking for more opportunities to learn and grow in the culinary world. In addition, I am currently pursuing work as a Food Stylist Assistant.</p>

<p>One of the happiest days of my culinary career was creating my sister’s wedding cake. This particular style was a naked vanilla lemon cake with a cheesecake layer, graham cracker pie dough crumb, and raspberry buttercream frosting. After the event, I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/65jlx2/homemade_i_made_my_sisters_wedding_cake/" target="_blank">posted a picture of it</a> to Reddit's most popular food section, reddit.com/r/food, and received an incredible response.</p>

<blockquote>
  I'm super impressed. It looks much better than the commercial ones... and they cost a small fortune and have to be ordered months in advance! You should go into business.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  So stunning. It looks so pretty and rustic, I would (almost) want to preserve it instead of eating it!
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  It looks incredible! Would you bake a cake for me? I don't have a wedding coming up. Or a birthday. I just want cake.
